# Open Weather

A light weight web client for displaying local weather

### About

Initially created for the FirefoxOS ecosystem this is now a Progressive Web Application which only requires a modern web browser in order to use it. The application was completely remade from scratch using Typescript.

You can check the page app to get more details about it [here](https://www.roabhi.es/OpenWeather/index.html) 

### Support

Just add the page to your home screen (the way to do this may vary from one browser/OS to another). Support on mobile devices is pretty good except for Safari on iOs.

### Demo

Demo is right [here](https://www.roabhi.es/ow-new/). Obviously the app looks nicer on a mobile device :P

### Credits

I am using [weatherapi](https://www.weatherapi.com/) to get location data and also weather forecast. Great API and service. You need to get your own API key over there in order to `npm run start`. Just add your key into `scr/ts/globals/globals.index.ts` and you are good to go.

### Install

`npm install`
